                The Society for Biomaterials & Artificial Organs India (SBAOI) was formed in 1986 and registered under
                the Travancore-Cochin Act XII of 1955, (act for registration of literary, scientific and charitable
                societies) with the name Society for Biomaterials and Artificial Organs - India with the following
                objectives. This Society will not only cultivate an atmosphere nationwide for the growth of basic and
                technological oriented research in Biomaterials and Artificial Organs but also bring the professionals
                from various faculties together to improve the quality of their approach in future research. This is
                done by communication among all members, by developing a Society newsletter and also by arranging
                workshops with laboratory demonstrations, where learning and exchange of relevant concepts are
                stimulated every year. The Society is administered by its office bearers consisting of the President,
                two Vice presidents, the General Secretary and Treasurer elected from the executive committee
